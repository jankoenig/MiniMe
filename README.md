## Configuration

### Staging

This project uses 3 different stages:
* `local`: Personal development that uses the [Jovo Webhook](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/webhook) for efficient local development (each team member has their own webhook URL)
* `dev`: Team environment to test the current status of the project (hosted in the cloud, e.g. AWS Lambda)
* `prod`: Live version of the project (hosted in the cloud, e.g. AWS Lambda)
